# meteor-vite (internal test package)
This is a test package for [`meteor-vite`](https://github.com/JorgenVatle/meteor-vite). Used to validate internal state
of npm packages bundled by Meteor instead of Vite.

If you found this in one of the example projects, you can safely remove this as a dependency.
